Description             : While I enjoy the vanilla gameplay, the pistol is
                          too weak to have a reason to use after obtaining the
                          chaingun.  I made this mod to make the pistol
                          more useful than a starting weapon.

                          powerpistol-lite.pk3 includes the following
                          changes:

                          - The pistol deals 40% more damage per
                          bullet.  This doesn't only make it more
                          powerful, but also provides significantly
                          higher ammo efficiency than chaingun.

                          - ZombieMan also sees an upgrade of more
                          damage (33% in mean value, 40% in max
                          value), making it more of a real threat.

                          powerpistol-full.pk3 includes a few sound
                          changes in addition to the above changes:

                          - The pistol now uses the Doom3 pistol
                          sound, to differentiate with the chaingun
                          whose power is unchanged.

                          - The ZombieMan's gunshot now has its own
                          sound effect to reflect its upgraded power.
                          The change of sounds also serves as a
                          reminder that the mod is correctly loaded,
                          because the power upgrades are otherwise too
                          subtle to notice.

                          - ChaingunGuy's gunshot sound is now the
                          same as player's chaingun, as they deal the
                          same damage per bullet.

                          - SpiderMastermind's super chaingun uses Doom3
                          chaingun sound effect.

Additional Credits to   : TerryWADArchive for making the d3snds mod which
                          is where the Doom3 sounds are from.

                          soundbible.com for the "Gun Fire" sample which
                          becomes ZombieMan's new gunshot sound.
